Project Title: Android Unit Converter App

Project Description:
The Android Unit Converter App is a versatile and user-friendly mobile application developed in Kotlin, designed to provide seamless unit conversion across data, length, weight, and temperature. The app's intuitive user interface allows users to effortlessly convert values between various predefined units in these categories.

Upon launching the app, users are presented with a user-friendly interface that displays input fields for value and a dropdown menu for selecting the source unit, as well as another dropdown for choosing the target unit. The predefined unit options ensure quick and accurate conversions across different measurement systems.

The app also features two essential buttons:
1) Convert: When the user inputs a value and selects the source and target units, clicking this button triggers the conversion process, which promptly displays the converted value.
2) Clear: This button enables users to reset both the input and converted values, allowing them to start fresh with a new conversion.
3) Back to Main: A convenient button that returns users to the main activity screen, ensuring seamless navigation and user experience.

The Android Unit Converter App simplifies the process of unit conversion for data, length, weight, and temperature, making it a valuable tool for anyone who needs to convert measurements quickly and accurately while on the go.
